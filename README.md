# How-To-Create-LostSaga-Private-Server

[help] How to create a lost saga private server.
I noticed that there is no guide that shows in detail how to start approaching the problem, the guide that I propose is a base from which to start, someone should add a solution on how:
1) What to do with Server files, how to compile them, how to run them, how to use them for a p2p server.
2) To be able to compile the Client without errors
3) Tips to improve and extend the guide, Github public repository:
