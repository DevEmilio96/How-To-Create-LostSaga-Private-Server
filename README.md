# How to create a lost saga private server

[HELP] How to create a LostSaga private server
I noticed that there is no guide that shows in detail how to start addressing the problem, the guide I propose is a base from which to start, someone should add a solution on how:

1) What to do with server files, how to use them for a p2p server.
2) To be able to compile the Client without errors.
3) To improve the guide.
