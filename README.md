# How to create a lost saga private server

[HELP] How to create a LostSaga private server
I noticed that there is no guide that shows in detail how to start addressing the problem, the guide I propose is a base from which to start, someone should add a solution on how:

1) What to do with server files, how to use them for a p2p server.
2) To be able to compile the Client without errors.
3) To improve the guide.

The file is a word, you can download it in the github repository.You can edit this file however you want, but only do so if you are sure of what you write. Those who will be most helpful, if they wish, can become the developers of this project, then sign up for github and apply to be a contributor.
